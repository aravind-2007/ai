# Program to Transpose a Matrix

# Define a matrix
A = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [7, 8, 9]]

# Initialize an empty transpose matrix with 0s
transpose = [[0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0]]

# Transpose logic
for i in range(len(A)):
    for j in range(len(A[0])):
        transpose[j][i] = A[i][j]

# Display result
print("Original Matrix:")
for row in A:
    print(row)

print("\nTranspose of Matrix:")
for row in transpose:
    print(row)
